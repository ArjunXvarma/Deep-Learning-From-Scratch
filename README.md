# Deep-Learning-From-Scratch
This project aims to help beginners understand how a neural network is built from the ground up. The project consists of a class that can be used to create a model and train it on the MNIST dataset to recognise numbers. This repository also contains the math that is essential to understand how a networks are created and trained.
